PROJECT LICENSE

This project was submitted by Lorna Yen as part of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree.

According to Udacity Honor Code, every student's submissions must not plagiarize the work of others, which means it 
must be their own work. Hence, if you submit my project as yours, it will cause you to violate the Udacity Honor Code, 
leading to reject your submissions even removing you from our programs with no refund.

Me, the author of the project, allow you to check the code as a reference, but if
you use my original work and submit it directly, it's your own responsibility if you get expelled.
